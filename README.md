Exploring Spatial Blog Companion Website
=========================================

This project contains the code from my web "Exploring Spatial" website, a companion site for the https://smitchell.github.io blog. The blog is
just a personal technology journal where I document what I learn as I explore GIS and mapping software for my job. I've
found that documenting what I learn in my blog is a good learning aid. Making my journal public forces me to dig deeper and be more thorough.

The website's purpose is to host companion code examples for my blog posts. Some are nothing more than Hello World demos straight from framework websites, while others go a little bit deeper.

The site is built as a single-page website using Backbone.js, so much of the code may be found in Backbone Views under /js/views/demos.
I closed my S-Corporation, Byteworks, in 2010 when I joined Garmin International, but I've resurrected my ByteworksInc.com site CSS template to host these labs.

Feel free to browse this code, reuse what you see, or offer comments or code refinements.
